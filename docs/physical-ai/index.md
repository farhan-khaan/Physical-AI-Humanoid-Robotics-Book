# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** - your comprehensive guide to building intelligent systems that interact with the physical world.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

This book bridges the gap between **digital intelligence** and **physical embodiment**, teaching you how to apply AI to control humanoid robots. You'll learn:

- 🧠 **Embodied Intelligence**: How AI systems perceive and act in the physical world
- 🔌 **Sensors & Actuators**: The "nervous system" that connects robots to reality
- 🎮 **Simulation**: Building and testing digital twins before real-world deployment
- ⚙️ **Control Strategies**: From classical PID to modern learned controllers
- 🚀 **Capstone Project**: Integrate everything into a complete robotic system

## 👥 Who This Book Is For

This book is designed for **students and practitioners** who want to apply AI to control humanoid robots. You should have:

- Basic programming knowledge (Python preferred)
- Fundamental understanding of AI/ML concepts
- Curiosity about robotics and physical systems
- Access to simulation tools (no physical robot required!)
