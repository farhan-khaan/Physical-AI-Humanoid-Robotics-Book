# Chapter 5: Capstone Project

Congratulations on making it this far! Now it's time to put everything together in a comprehensive project that demonstrates your mastery of Physical AI and humanoid robotics.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this capstone, you will be able to:

1. **Design** a complete Physical AI system from concept to implementation
2. **Integrate** sensors, actuators, simulation, and control strategies
3. **Implement** a working humanoid robot behavior (in simulation or hardware)
4. **Debug** and iterate on complex robotic systems
5. **Document** your design decisions and results professionally
6. **Present** your work to demonstrate understanding

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Completion of Chapters 1-4
- Proficiency with simulation tools
- Strong programming skills in Python
- Understanding of all major concepts: embodied intelligence, sensors/actuators, simulation, control

## 🗺️ Chapter Overview

This chapter provides:

1. **[Project Ideas](./project-ideas.md)** - Suggested capstone projects at various difficulty levels
2. **[Requirements](./requirements.md)** - What your project must include
3. **[Evaluation Rubric](./evaluation-rubric.md)** - How your work will be assessed
4. **[Examples](./examples.md)** - Sample projects from past students

## 🎓 Capstone Philosophy

The capstone is your opportunity to:
- Apply everything you've learned
- Solve a problem you find interesting
- Build something you're proud of
- Demonstrate readiness for real-world robotics work

:::tip Choose Wisely
Pick a project that excites you! You'll spend significant time on this, so passion matters.

## 🏗️ Project Requirements

Your capstone must demonstrate:

1. **Embodied Intelligence** - Clear sense-think-act loop
2. **Sensor Integration** - Multiple sensor types working together
3. **Actuator Control** - Precise, safe actuation
4. **Simulation** - Digital twin testing before deployment
5. **Control Strategy** - Appropriate architecture for your task
6. **Real-World Readiness** - Consider noise, delays, failures
