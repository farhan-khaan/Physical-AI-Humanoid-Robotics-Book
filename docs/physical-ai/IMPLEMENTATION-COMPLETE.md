## 🔧 Configuration Changes

### 1. Sidebar Configuration (`sidebars.ts`)
```typescript
// Changed from autogenerated to custom structure
tutorialSidebar: [
  'intro',
  'learning outcomes',
  'Why Physical AI Matters',
  {
    type: 'category',
    label: '📚 Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics',
    collapsed: false,
    items: [/* 5 chapters */]
  },
  // ... existing modules
]
```

### 2. Docusaurus Config (`docusaurus.config.ts`)
```typescript
// Changed to allow broken links during development
onBrokenLinks: 'warn', // was 'throw'
```
**Reason**: Allows links to future pages (Chapters 2-5 content)
